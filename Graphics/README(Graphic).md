# Dev's note

In this version, only the 'end graphic' is made due to time limitations <br />
However, I will develop them as paintings/turtle graphics later on<br />
I think of this project as part of a personal capsule but for submission<br />
I only make up to end graphics for now<br />
But I planned to continue this project in my free time after submission<br />

Plans:
- Finish Graphics<br />
- Add shadow,hue,lighten functions to class Color, and move 'the_end' to clothing.csv(s) as Pajamas<br />
- Add more choices and story details
