For people who wants to try drawing with python turtle like me<br />
First, plan out a simple drawing in a drawing template,<br />
ex. plain paper, digital drawing software like Krita or iArtbook<br />
then, trace of them then plot your turtle's path<br />
Like making trace the dots drawing books, but in a seperate layer from your drawing<br />
For people who use physical medium to plot your drawing, it would be wise to upload your drawings to your computer before plotting your turtle's path<br />
<br />
For coding,<br />
Make a curve function that can change direction to left/right<br />
Then make your turtle follow the path you've plotted<br />
It's hard to know turtle's output from eyesight<br />
But you can plot turtle's actions without definite distance<br />
Then, you can fix values to match your drawing<br />
Like bending wires to make shapes, but with turtle graphic<br />
I used a angle measurer to help tweaks lines faster<br />
But this is going to take a while<br />
as you're coding, ctrl+/ or command+/ the parts you don't need to check if your input is correct<br />
Work on adjusting from top to bottom, because the earlier codes affect later codes directly<br />
so, start a few days in advance of the deadline based on the complexity of your drawings<br />
<br />
* whole days: literally, all day you're coding, including during classes<br />
<br />
* (+): Unfinished graphics
--- Rounded time used to make graphic ---<br />
1.The end = 4 whole days(+) <br />
<br />

--- Advice I haven't tried yet ---<br />
* It would be fantastic to be able to put in the plotted drawing inside the turtle canvas<br />
* Is there a way to scroll the turtle's path up to the point you have to fix, and only alter paths that mattered and show the difference immediately?, it could make this from 3 whole days to just 3 hours
* make a seperate visualization app and make it code building blocks

managed to finish mid to Samantha body, I supposed this is only up to as much as the deadline allows me
