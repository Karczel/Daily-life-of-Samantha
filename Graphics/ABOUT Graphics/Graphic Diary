For people who wants to try drawing with python turtle like me
First, plan out a simple drawing in a drawing template,
ex. plain paper, digital drawing software like Krita or iArtbook
then, trace of them then plot your turtle's path
Like making trace the dots drawing books, but in a seperate layer from your drawing
For people who use physical medium to plot your drawing, it would be wise to upload your drawings to your computer before plotting your turtle's path

For coding,
Make a curve function that can change direction to left/right
Then make your turtle follow the path you've plotted
It's hard to know turtle's output from eyesight
But you can plot turtle's actions without definite distance
Then, you can fix values to match your drawing
Like bending wires to make shapes, but with turtle graphic
I used a angle measurer to help tweaks lines faster
But this is going to take a while
as you're coding, ctrl+/ or command+/ the parts you don't need to check if your input is correct
Work on adjusting from top to bottom, because the earlier codes affect later codes directly
so, start a few days in advance of the deadline based on the complexity of your drawings

* whole days: literally, all day you're coding, including during classes

- Rounded time used to make graphic -
1.The end = 3 whole days

- Advice I haven't tried yet -
It would be fantastic to be able to put in the plotted drawing inside the turtle canvas
